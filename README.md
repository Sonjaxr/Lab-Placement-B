# Lab Placement - Bioinformatics

This repository contains the documentation and work related to my lab placement as part of my Master's study in Molecular Medicine, with a focus on bioinformatics.

## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to HNF1B [briefly describe the main research question or objective of your lab placement]. This involves analyzing large biological datasets using computational tools and pipelines.

This repository serves as a structured log of my daily activities, analyses, and findings.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

-   `lab_notes/`: Contains daily notes in Markdown format. Each note is named using the `YYYY-MM-DD.md` convention.
-   `resources/`: A collection of links to software, tutorials, and other relevant resources.

I am excited to contribute to this research and learn from this experience.
