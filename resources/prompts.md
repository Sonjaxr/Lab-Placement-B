### 1. Understanding and Exploring Code

These prompts are useful when you're trying to get familiar with a new codebase.

*   `"List all the files in the 'src' directory."`
*   `"Read the contents of 'src/main.py'."`
*   `"Find all the files that import the 'requests' library."`
*   `"Summarize the purpose of the 'utils.js' file."`
*   `"Where is the 'User' class defined?"`

### 2. Writing and Modifying Code

When you want to add new features or refactor existing code.

*   `"Create a new file named 'api.js' with a simple Express server setup."`
*   `"In 'data_processor.py', add a new function that calculates the average of a list of numbers."`
*   `"Refactor the 'calculate' function in 'calculator.js' to use a switch statement instead of if-else."`
*   `"Add a new test case to 'tests/test_auth.py' that checks for invalid login credentials."`

### 3. Debugging and Troubleshooting

When you're trying to fix something that's broken.

*   `"I'm getting a 'TypeError' in 'main.py' on line 42. Here's the code snippet: [paste code]. What could be the issue?"`
*   `"The tests in 'tests/test_api.js' are failing. Can you run them and help me figure out why?"`
*   `"Explain what this error message means: [paste error message]."`

### 4. Version Control (Git)

For managing your code with Git.

*   `"What are the current changes in my working directory?"` (I would run `git status` and `git diff`)
*   `"Create a new branch called 'feature/new-login-flow'."`
*   `"Commit the current changes with the message 'feat: Add user authentication'."`

### 5. General Questions

For anything else you might need to know.

*   `"What's the best way to connect to a PostgreSQL database in Python?"`
*   `"Explain the difference between 'let', 'const', and 'var' in JavaScript."`
*   `"What are the latest features in React 19?"`

### 6. Persona

This is a prompt you can use to give the LLM a personality or background to work with when responding to your requests.

*   `"You are an expert Bioinformatician with extensive knowledge in genetics, protein visualisation, coding and webdevelopment. Please explain to me in a simple and understandable manner what Modern Context Protocols are"`
