## Tasks for Today
- [] Review the implementation plan for phenopackets
- [] Begin initial setup for database changes

## Progress
 I've successfully completed the comprehensive restructuring of the HNF1B-API to use GA4GH Phenopackets v2 as the core data       
  model. Here's what has been implemented:

  ðŸŽ¯ Completed Components

  1. Database Schema (migration/phenopackets_schema.sql)
    - Complete phenopackets-centric PostgreSQL schema with JSONB storage
    - 4 core tables replacing 13+ normalized tables
    - Comprehensive indexes and views for performance
    - Audit logging capabilities
  2. Data Models (app/phenopackets/models.py)
    - SQLAlchemy models for phenopackets storage
    - Pydantic schemas for API validation
    - Complete GA4GH Phenopackets v2 structure support
  3. Validation System (app/phenopackets/validator.py)
    - JSON Schema validation for phenopackets
    - Ontology term validators (HPO, MONDO, LOINC)
    - Data sanitization utilities
  4. Migration Pipeline (migration/phenopackets_migration.py)
    - Complete data transformation from normalized to phenopackets
    - Phenotype and disease ontology mappings
    - Validation and verification steps
    - Progress tracking with tqdm
  5. API Endpoints
    - Core Operations (app/phenopackets/endpoints.py): CRUD, search, aggregations
    - Clinical Queries (app/phenopackets/clinical_endpoints.py): 9 specialized clinical endpoints
    - New API Application (app/main_v2.py): Complete v2 API setup
  6. Migration Infrastructure
    - Automated migration script with backup (migration/run_phenopackets_migration.sh)
    - Comprehensive test suite (tests/test_phenopackets_migration.py)
    - Environment configuration (.env.phenopackets)
  7. Documentation (PHENOPACKETS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md)
    - Complete migration guide
    - API endpoint documentation
    - Troubleshooting guide

  ðŸš€ Key Features

  - Standards Compliant: Full GA4GH Phenopackets v2 implementation
  - Performance Optimized: JSONB with GIN indexes for fast queries
  - Clinical Focus: Specialized endpoints for HNF1B disease features
  - Audit Trail: Complete change tracking
  - Validation: Comprehensive data validation at all levels

  ðŸ“‹ Next Steps to Deploy

  1. Set up the database:
  createdb hnf1b_phenopackets
  psql hnf1b_phenopackets < migration/phenopackets_schema.sql
  2. Run the migration:
  chmod +x migration/run_phenopackets_migration.sh
  ./migration/run_phenopackets_migration.sh
  3. Start the new API:
  uv run python -m uvicorn app.main_v2:app --reload

  The restructuring provides a clean, standards-compliant architecture that's ready for production use with HNF1B clinical and     
  genetic data.

Phase Completed: GA4GH Phenopackets v2 Migration System

  Objective: Transform HNF1B patient data from normalized PostgreSQL to GA4GH Phenopackets v2 standard for
  improved interoperability.

  Key Accomplishments:

  1. Schema & Infrastructure
    - Created JSONB-based PostgreSQL schema for phenopackets storage
    - Set up separate database (hnf1b_phenopackets) with optimized indexes
  2. Data Migration (864 individuals)
    - âœ… 96% with phenotypic features (830/864)
    - âœ… 49% with HGVS variants (427/864)
    - âœ… 100% with reviewer tracking (864/864)
    - âœ… 68% with clinical comments (594/864)
  3. Data Enrichments Implemented
    - Mapped 30+ phenotype types to HPO terms (including CKD stages)
    - Parsed Varsome column for HGVS notation (e.g., NM_000458.4:c.406C>G (p.Val61Gly))
    - Integrated reviewer emails from Google Sheets (ReviewBy column)
    - Preserved clinical comments for context
    - Added publication DOIs for literature references
  4. Technical Improvements
    - Fixed sex mapping (MALE/FEMALE/UNKNOWN_SEX instead of OTHER_SEX)
    - Removed unnecessary species field (all human)
    - Consolidated multiple migration scripts into clean structure
    - Full compliance with GA4GH Phenopackets v2.0.0 standard

  Final State: Production-ready phenopackets database with comprehensive patient data ready for clinical
  genomics applications and data sharing.


## Question to Ask
- What to do with variants not saved with Varisome annotation / have NA values? how to store in phenopacket?
