## Tasks for Today
- [] Look into using chart js instead of plotly js
- [] Play around with visualisation to improve web interface

### [New Knowledge]
- Chart.js was not able to implement as complex visual charts as plotly so I decided to stick with Plotly instead.
- Increased size of individual variant plot points for better visibility & increased jitter to separate them more too.
