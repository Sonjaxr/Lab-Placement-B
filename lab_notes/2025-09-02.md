## Tasks for Today

- [x] Look into linting
- [x] Work on the MCP info and prompts files
- [x] Fix distance display option of residue to DNA

## Lint
- Tools flagging suspicious/problematic usage in software written in any computer language
- Highlight semantic & stylistic problems in source code 
- Allows for correction of subtle programming errors or coding practices which could lead to errors.
    - E.g. undefined variables; calls to undefined functions; attempts at redefining built-in types of functions 
- Many different linter extensions for VSC; can use multiple at the same time. 

- UV for installing packages 
- Ruff for linting 

## To Do 
- Remove Ter variants (don't result in translated protein hence not relevant in distance visualisation)
- Use Varsome table to extract the correct variant nominclature
- Create an analysis to see whether pathogenicity of variant correlates with distance to DNA
    - Make a box or violin plot for 2 Groups:
        - Pathogenic & VUS
    - Include a scatterplot to be able to visualise individual point
    - Add a significance test 
- Check which libraries are needed to undergo this 
- Look into possible EUIs for visualisation of plots
- Work on a summary file including topics such as
    - prompt engineering 
    - context engineering 
    - Include an example of Claude vs Gemini and give an evaluation of how well they do in certain aspects
    - Include a possible experiment to test their differences
    -   i.e. one shot technique
