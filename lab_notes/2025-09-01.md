# Daily Log: 2025-09-01

## Tasks for Today
- [x] Familiarise myself with working with LLMs in the terminal 
- [x] Setup issue for displaying distance of AA residue to DNA helix
- [x] Setup issue to have various display options for the surface of the molecule/protein
- [x] Work on solving issues created

## Major Features Implemented

### 1. DNA Distance Visualization
- **Purpose**: Analyze which variants directly affect DNA binding vs protein structure
- **Key Components**:
  - `DistanceCalculator.js` - Calculates distances between protein residues and DNA atoms
  - Distance measurements displayed for each variant (e.g., "3.2Å to DNA")
  - Color-coded distances: Red (<5Å direct contact), Orange (5-10Å), Green (>10Å)
  - Dual sorting modes: By pathogenicity OR by distance to DNA
  - Filter variants by proximity ranges
  - "Show All Distances" toggle button for simultaneous visualization
- **Scientific Value**: Identifies variants affecting DNA binding directly

### 2. Multiple Protein Display Options
- **Purpose**: View protein structure from different perspectives
- **Representations Added** (6 total):
  - **Cartoon**: Secondary structures (helices/sheets)
  - **Surface**: Molecular surface, binding pockets
  - **Ball & Stick**: Classic atomic model
  - **Sticks**: All bonds representation
  - **Ribbon**: Simplified backbone
  - **Backbone**: Minimal trace
- **Advanced Controls**:
  - Color schemes: Secondary structure, Element, Hydrophobicity, Rainbow, B-factor
  - Opacity slider (works with Surface, Cartoon, Ribbon)
  - Sidechain display toggle
- **Auto-adjustments**: Surface representation defaults to 70% opacity

### 3. UI/UX Improvements
- DNA displays by default on load (better initial context)
- Toggle buttons show current state ("Show/Hide")
- Loading indicators for smooth transitions
- Smart disabling of incompatible options
- Responsive design maintained

### Technical Architecture
- **Modular structure**: Separated JS classes and CSS files
- **New files created**:
  - `js/DistanceCalculator.js`
  - `js/RepresentationManager.js`  
  - `css/distances.css`
  - `css/representations.css`
- **Libraries used**: NGL.js (no additional dependencies needed)

## Things to work on 
- [x] Clean up file names keeping a coventional format and structure 
- [ ] Make a folder called DATA -> within have scripts for extraction 
- Inform youself what linting is: einheitlicher code style common js linted 
    - how to name variables
    - to make the code readable/understandable and usable by everyone 
- Feature für branch und pull request 
- Look into Possible association/correlation pathogenicity to distance to DNA -> statistical test? 
- Hosten auf GitHub -> GithubPages
    - Github actions automatisert wird 
- Blast crystal vs alpha fold of HNF1B 
    - help with prediction of varaint effects on prot struct.
- Discuss different methods used 
    - copy paste
    - copilot
    - terminal
- Resources 
    - MCPs 
    - Commands/Prompts for diff personas
    - Summary of miniproject
