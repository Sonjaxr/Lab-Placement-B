## Tasks for Today

- [ ] Introduction to basic background on informatics
- [ ] Recap on knowledge of genetics
- [ ] Small introduction to background of the HNF1B variants project

## Progress

### Task 1: [Intro to Informatics]

- Consists of Front- & Backend
 - Frontend = Browser uses:
    - HTML
    - JS
    - CSS
 - Backend = Server consists of:
    - database in SQL type format
    - API (= middlewear) using XML or JSON 


### Task 2: [Genetics] 

- WGS = whole genome sequencing covers whole DNA including protein coding & non coding regions -> expensive and a lot of data.
Hence WES = **whole exome sequencing**: targets only protein coding regions of the DNA, useful to identify rare genetic variants of Mendelian diseases in an individual. 
Can further target sequencing using specified pannels or arrays.
Once the genome is sequenced it needs alignment to a reference genome to identify/locate genetics variants.
Variants can be 
 - CNVs (greater than 50bp)
 - Point mutations 
 - Indels etc.
Consequences:
 - truncation via premature stop codon -> mRNA nonsense mediated decay
 - alternative splicing w/ intron retention or exon exlusion
 - Change in AA 
 - Frameshift 
Most relevant are varaints leading to a fs with truncation or splicing effects
To identify disease causing variant need to filter:
- variant already reported as pathogenic likely disruptive? 
- Filter out variants reported as benign 
- Filter out common variants (greater than 1% of popl)

### Task 3: [HNF1B Project Description] 
- Gene variants in HNF1B (17q12del) microdeletions most common monogenic cause of developmental KD 
- Other disorders including neurodevelopmental disorders also reported/associated with 17q12del
- No fully defined phenotype-genotype associations for kidney function 
- What has been done:
    - Literature on reported patients with HNF1B variants collected 
    - List created of patients with according variants and phenotypes reported 
- Aim:
    - create webpage visualising variants and phenotypes (using HPO terms)
    - allow for addition of new variants / phenotypes by medical professionals to keep list updated and reflect new findings 


## Plan for Tomorrow

- [ ] Install programs needed for project
- [ ] Signup for Github and request student benfits
