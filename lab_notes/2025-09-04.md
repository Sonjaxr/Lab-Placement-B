## Tasks for Today
- [] Improve the statsitical test & graphs
- [] Consider possible ways to display the graphs on the website

## Summary of Today's Progress
Statistical Analysis & Visualization Enhancement
- Created new interactive statistics page (statistics.html) for variant distance analysis using Plotly.js v2.27.0 for interactive visualizations
- Fixed statistical test implementation in the analysis script (corrected test methodology)
- Improved visual output quality for statistical plots with interactive violin plots and distribution visualizations

Code Quality & Standards
- Refactored Python scripts to comply with PEP 8 conventions
- Minor CSS improvements to variant styling

Key Deliverables:
- Interactive statistical visualization page powered by Plotly.js for exploring variant-DNA distance patterns
- Corrected statistical analysis providing more accurate results
- Cleaner, more maintainable Python codebase following industry standards

## To Do
- [] Look into using chart js instead of plotly js
- [] Play around with visualisation to improve web interface
